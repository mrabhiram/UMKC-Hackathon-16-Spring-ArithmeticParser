# UMKC-Hackathon-16-Spring-ArithmeticParser
Python application for Arithmetic parser. It can parse equations with arithmetic, logical and boolean operators.

Example
A Mathematical equation which includes Arithmetic, logical and boolean operators 

((x%y)*z - 56 + a/t) && (True && (-b/4ac))

Such complicated equations can be computed using out parser. 
The performance compared to Python in built method "eval" is give below
